Disturbances, both external and internal, are a constant challenge for organisms. In spite of 
perturbations and uncertainties, it is remarkable how biological systems produce stable 
behavior and morphology. The characteristic of a biological system that responds to 
disturbance and ensures that the output is inconvenient in the case of considerable noise is 
known as stability or insensitivity. Biorobustness reflects the degree of variation in a biological 
system and is therefore important for systematic evolution. Frailty is defined as a syndrome 
of old age characterized by a reduction in the physiological reserves an individual needs to 
respond to both endogenous and exogenous stress. Using a discrete frailty definition that 
includes sedentary behavior, involuntary weight loss, fatigue, poor muscle strength, and slow 
walking pace, "frailty" was associated with increased disability, postoperative complications, 
and increased mortality. Despite the strong association between frailty and subsequent poor 
outcomes, limited attention has been paid to this common disease of old age in clinical 
Settings. A more fundamental understanding of the underlying biological factors that 
contribute to vulnerable phenotypes has begun to emerge. Multiple underlying biological 
factors, such as dysregulation of inflammatory processes, genomic instability, oxidative stress, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, and cellular aging, appear to contribute to the clinical presentation 
of frailty.
